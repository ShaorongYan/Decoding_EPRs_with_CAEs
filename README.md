# Decoding_ERPs_with_CAEs
Here are the codes we used for a project where we trained Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) and used the decoder component of the autoencoder to decode ERPs from language predictors. For details about the project, see our CMCL 2019 paper and our full length paper. 

We have explored different architectures. Here we are using the codes we used to train our alpha model (our best performing model) as an example.
